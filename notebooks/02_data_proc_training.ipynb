Soon after the superior performance of Wav2Vec2 was demonstrated on the English ASR dataset LibriSpeech, *Facebook AI* presented XLSR-Wav2Vec2 (click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13979)). XLSR stands for *cross-lingual  speech representations* and refers to XLSR-Wav2Vec2`s ability to learn speech representations that are useful across multiple languages.\n",

Similar, to [BERT's masked language modeling](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), the model learns contextualized speech representations by randomly masking feature vectors before passing them to a transformer network.\n",

However, the encoded labels should not be grouped when decoding since they don't correspond to the predicted tokens of the model, which is why the `group_tokens=False` parameter has to be passed.
